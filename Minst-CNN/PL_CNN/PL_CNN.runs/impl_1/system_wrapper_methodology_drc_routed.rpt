There is a large setup violation of -2.734 ns between system_i/memory/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_IBTTCC.I_S2MM_MSTR_IBTTCC/sig_input_addr_reg_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/memory/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_IBTTCC.I_S2MM_MSTR_IBTTCC/sig_realigner_btt2_reg[19]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
